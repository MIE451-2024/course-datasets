Very friendly and anticipatory of our needs and answered all our questions. He's the best. We arrived early and stored our bags, no problem. Upon check-in later on, we had just placed our bags and an attendant brought us a bottle of wine, 2 glasses and some chocolates. A very nice touch! To be honest neither was very good, but it's still the thought that counts.\n\nLater on when settling in, I noticed some hair on the pillow and also some sticky glass marks on the side table. Not impressed at all. I wanted to call to mention, but it was already late and we didn't have the energy. I wiped it myself and cringingly took off the previous guests' hair from the pillow. \n\nThe room was oddly set up in a way (accessible room, so larger), with the mini fridge right in front of the end of the bed just sitting on the floor. When we went to make coffee, we had to move the coffee maker because there was no plug where it was sitting on the dresser. We actually had to set it up on the table by the two chairs in the corner, which was quite awkward. \n\nWe realized we had forgotten to ask the gentleman for a late check out and therefore called and asked a cold and unprofessional woman for even the slightest late check-out to which she declined. Now, I work in a hotel and I do the same job as her, and I couldn't believe her attitude. She was extremely casual, saying \""I don't think so, but lemme check\"", and then a solid \""no\"". Well, I know they weren't busy the next day, which was a Monday, because I checked the rates a million times when deciding which day to come. Monday was one of the cheapest days!  Saturday was sold out so we had stayed over Sunday night. And check-out is an extremely early 11am. Not even 11:30am? \""It's our anniversary\"", I said. She simply said no. \n\nNow back to the good...The outdoor hot tubs were super cool! Yes, it was freezing out, and yes, we froze our butts off running the 30 seconds to hop in, but it was worth it. Very unique experience, especially at night.  Perfect for our anniversary.\n\nOverall it was just below average. I didn't expect much, considering it was the cheapest option we saw, but I did expect a clean room. I expected at least average customer service. Would we stay here again? No. But we'll probably choose another ski resort altogether next time anyway. At least the skiing was fun.",2,negative,"March 20, 2017",108 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

In previous visits to Blue Mountain I have stayed at the Westin, Mosiac, Seasons and The Grand Georgian.  For the price we typically get right in the village for a regular room we decided to get a king suite at the Blue Mountain Inn.   The room had a king sized bed in a separate room.  The main room had a couch, chair, coffee table, a small desk, TV, fireplace, small\u002Fhigh kitchen table for 4 and a wet bar.  The area with the table and wet bar had a huge built in shelving unit with doors but I wasn't sure of the purpose.   The kitchen area did not have a microwave, toaster, dishes or cutlery so I'm not sure why so much shelving space would be needed in a kitchen area.  \n\nThe room was clean but the carpet was buckled in a couple spots.  We had enough towels for the two of us but one of them was so old and tattered, it was full of loose threads.  My husband is not fussy but he even commented on it suggesting he just put it in the garbage.  The bed was comfortable but the sheets were terrible, again my easy to please husband wondered if the thread count was 1.  The room did not have a suitcase holder, which we of course survived but it's a very common item in a hotel room and one I enjoy using so I did notice this luxury item missing. \n\nThe hotel is not far from the main village and they do offer a free shuttle that runs back and forth all day and night.  We used it a couple times instead of walking and I don't think we ever waited more than 3 minutes for it to show up.  \n\nOverall there's not a lot wrong with this hotel but I'd much rather spend a little extra to stay in the village.  For the price we paid for a suite at The Blue Mountain Inn we could stay in the village in a room that has a kitchen with all the dishes and small appliances you need, plus all the shops and restaurants at your doorstep.

No one at the other end seemed to know anything about the call, but assured us there was no problem. Just to be sure we enquired further and were given information about someone else's reservation. Not great.\n\nUpon arrival we encountered a nearly 10 minute wait to be greeted at check in. Each of the 3 front desk staff took at least that long to deal with guests, including a large group that needed wrist bands for some reason. Worse was that upon speaking to the clerk, we were directed to another building to find our room. This would have been useful information to have known before we unloaded the car (maybe a good subject for the phone call?). The other building was not nearby either, but across the street and around a bend which meant reloading the car, unloading again and finding another parking spot in a lot across the road. Adding to our inconvenience was that the unloading zone had only stairs with no ramp to wheel bags. The one elevator up to our floor was of some concern as it physically shook when people stepped on and off. \n\nThe room and bathroom was dark and felt a bit run down, with evidence of a door chain having been wrested from its frame sometime in the past. The toilet also had an unusual feature that caused it to half-flush in the middle of the night 3 or 4 times. \n\nWhile the outdoor pool was very nice, I was disappointed to see signs asking guests to use their towels judiciously as the property was running low - which seems like precisely the kind of thing a well managed property could accomodate for. So yeah, the $11 daily fee for wi-fi access felt exceedingly miserly given everything else.\n\nLastly, imagine our surprise at check out to find that the building we were in hadn't a key-drop station either, requiring to us to return to the desk at the original building we checked in at.\n\nOverall Blue Mountain Inn had the feel of an under-cared-for off-season party venue for frat house kids.

In the basement were two bedrooms a washroom and a third storage room which was unlocked full of electric tools and other various materials all of which were dangerous for the kids and because that's where the largest bedrooms were we had no choice but to put kids in there.

The chalet itself had all the right things for our trip. I started my mornings by making a simple breakfast, coffee, toast with the provided water boiler and toaster, took a 3 minute walk to base of the mountain and hiked up. When I got back in the afternoon the chalet was getting a bit hot, so I turned on the dual AC units and the whole chalet was comfortable within minutes. Initially I didn't know there were 2 units but I found the 2 thermostats. On the first night we ate at the Thai restaruant in main office. Excellent, I had doubts at first since the name was \""Thai Food\"" - sounded very generic but the cook is really Thai and the food was very good. This is not a Thai Express, or typical fast food Thai restaruant found in the city. The food is made to order and you must try the spring rolls and curries. Anyways back to the chalet, the hot tub is nice after hiking the mountain. The showers in the master bedroom was awesome, my son loved the body jets. Initially I didn't know how to turn them on, because it had 2 knobs and one of them was dual function, but I figured all the the taps in the house are pull on type, so I just pulled on the bottom knob and the water came on. I was quite surprised that when all the showers in the house were on we never ran out of hot water, I think it had dual water heaters.The basement had a table tennis and i played a few games with my dad during the night. The house also had wifi and we brought our own Chromcast and was able to watch everything. The TV has it's own power bar so you don't need to bring your own. The second night of our stay we cooked dinner and the large kitchen was good, the dining table was big enough for 12 people. We bought lots of grocries from the city but we didn't know that there was a walmart supercenter and other supermarkets just less than 10 minutes away (drive) in collingwood, so next time won't have to bring so many things. The kids had a fun time just running around and playing hide and seek in the chalet. Also at night, the yard is a great place to see stars. The bedrooms were all large and comfortable, everyone slept well at night, sheets and pillows all clean. I also think that i over packed for this trip, there are washers and dryers, so I didn't need to bring as many clothes as i did. The only thing disappointing I found was not really having the time to spend in the chalet, because of the many activities at blue mountain village.",4,positive,"September 15, 2016",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 0N6

We stayed at one of the large chalets that this company rents last week with a group of families - moms, dads, kids.  Wow.  Worst experience ever.  \n\nBut to be fair, first the positive.  The location of the chalet was great.  It was close to the North ski lift area - quite walkable.  Then again, if you bring a tent and put it up somewhere, that will also be close - but at least it would be safe, and clean.  You could not say that for the Chalet.  \n\nSecond point - the maintenance and cleaning staff were ultimately quite pleasant - we  know because we got to know them very well after their multiple attendances.  Some of them even told us about how many problems they had with this property, and that they were getting very tired of having to respond to complaints of other guests who have rented it.  \n\nWhen we arrived, the Chalet was filthy, and from the inside, it looked like it had been partied in - not like it was 1999 - but since 1999.  There were holes in the walls and doors.  Not a single light bulb in one of the rooms worked.  It was very 1800s for a while.  \n\nThe trim had been pulled off the walls.  The beds were rickety and unsafe.  The furniture was ripped.  The advertised Sauna didn't work.  The hot tub looked ok - until one of the kids lifted the rock that they were using to hold the filter in place.  Yes - they were using a rock to keep the filter in place.  Once that rock got lifted - look out.  It was a hair and nastiness invasion that turned the tub green and rendered it unusable.  The kitchen was insufficiently equipped, and dangerous.  The element on the bottom of the oven blew.  I went to get a glass from the cupboard, and it had an obvious giant crack in it.  Even the tap in the kitchen sink was so loose it was barely attached.  I could go on and on with the defects associated with this place.  Even the linens they provided to us were...well, to be polite for the sake of anyone who might read this - totally gross.  It looked like there was almost as much DNA there as in the hot tub.\n\nThe customer service was also appalling.  They were slow to respond.  Members of our group spent hours and hours of our vacation trying to get the issues with this place sorted out.  When we raised our complaints and asked for them to address the issue with us - we were told that Sheldon Rosen - the owner of this company advised his manager that although he was originally inclined to settle the issue with us, because we had \""called Bylaw Enforcement on them\"" due to the condition of this property, they were not even going to address the matter.  Yep - because we brought a number of concerns about apparent violations to the attention of the law enforcement officers whose job it is to keep short term occupants safe, the ethical business folks at the Lodges at Blue Mountain decided they weren't inclined to compensate us for the gong show they inflicted on us.  Nice work.\nSo - overall, a thoroughly disappointing experience and not recommended to anyone (unless you are looking to throw a knock em down, drag em out frat party).  On the other hand, if you ever wondered what it might be like to stay in a crack house - this would be a perfect accommodation experience for you.",1,negative,"January 10, 2018",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 0N6

This resort is not really within a short walking distance to the village (as was suggested to me over the phone), especially if you are travelling with someone who is elderly and\u002For children.  Although the grounds of the resort look fairly well maintained, the units themselves are clearly in need of attention.  The AC was not working in the first unit we were placed in.  When I attempted to call reception about the AC issue, I discovered that the phone was not working.  I later learned that all of the phones in each unit had been disconnected as a result of long distances calls being placed and billed to the owners of the units.  This means you need to walk or drive to the front of the resort to speak with someone every time you need something or have a question or concern.  The second room we were placed in had stains all over the carpet, the couch was very well used, the closet door was broken and the bedroom on the first floor had a bug issue (tiny little ants all over the window, on the carpet and yes, on the bed).

The only room available at the time of booking was studio loft at $200 + tax per night. This was not really in our budget for 2 of us, as this is not a 5 star resort or a hotel that includes breakfast and other numerous amenities. However it was the cheapest accommodation available in the Blue Mountain resort area for this weekend. \nWe arrived about 1 hour earlier before the actual check-in time and as we assumed there were no issues checking in early. The receptionist at the front desk did not seem very welcoming or interested in what she was doing. She made me sign a deposit for eventual damage in the amount $500 (I guess that is the rule, so no big deal). We were told where the location of our building is and the pass code for the door and that was all the interaction we had. We were pleased to find out that we were staying, actually, in a 1 bedroom loft apartment, which looked quite spacious, new and clean. We had 2 full bathrooms, large kitchen, 2 TVs and free Wi-Fi. We really could not ask for more given that we were staying there 1 night only. Bed was very comfortable as well as pillows. \nThe resort shuttle was quite comfortable to move around in the evening. Even though the resort advertises a \u201Cshort walk for the Village\u201D I would not recommend it. There are no sidewalks and walking on the road could be dangerous during the night time. The street is not very well lit and the passing cars might not see you. You can always call the shuttle or wait for it in front of the reception.\nOn the negative side there are some observations to be made. If you have neighbors in the same building, it can get noisy. A couple in the unit below us had a large dog that was barking continuously. Luckily we slept in the loft so it did not bother us too much. The grounds did not seem to be well maintained. Stairs to our unit were made of wood and worn down by the rain, snow, salt and other agents. Both of our balconies were covered by snow with plastic chairs laying on the ground waiting for the snow to melt. We did not need to go out on the balcony, but it would have been nice if they cleared the snow and stored the chairs inside. We found the heaters to be very loud and you could not regulate the heat in individual rooms. It was either too hot or too cold if you tried to regulate the temperature. We opted for the warmer version and sleeping without the covers. There was no remote control for the TV in the loft bedroom\nAs some other guests mentioned the telephone is not working. The resort should remove it from their amenities list. \nThe brochure we were given at the arrival indicated that the resort has an outdoor hot tub open 9am \u2013 9pm during winter times. We looked for it and when we asked another employee where it was, he told us that it was just around the building. He never mentioned that it was closed (or perhaps he did not even know it was closed for the season). \nThe resort has no convenience store so if you need any groceries or snacks, not there is one within the walking distance. You better get everything you need prior to our arrival. \nSince this was our first overnight stay and ski trip at the Blue Mountain we were expecting much more for the prices we paid. Since we were coming only for one night we did not plan to bring any food or drinks. We ended up spending $160 just for 1 course dinner and 3 drinks each. We also spent $30 for small breakfast and $20 for 2 Kit Kat snacks, 2 bottles of water and 1 tea. Luckily the ski passes were discounted at $20 per person and ski rental was $25 per person. Overall in 24 hours we spent $600 and this is Blue Mountain we are talking about, not St. Moritz, Aspen or some other worldwide known ski resort.

Precious time lost between my husband and I ( he works out of town and we see eachother for 1 weekend a month if we are lucky) all because They double booked and Refused to give us our money back! Oh and I forgot to mention that between arguing with Amanda and Laura, I contacted Booking.com to see if there was anything they could do on their part , maybe talk some sense into them. Booking. Com stated that they had spoken to the resort supervisor and was told our issue was decor only and we were demanding an upgrade( like we were being the unreasonable ones! )  and that the information of the rooms that they advertise come from the Resort themselves so it is liability to inaccuracy of the info given to me. Booking.com sent me the attached reply from this so called Resort to which I was mortified that a company would allow their team of staff to behave this way! I have sent all my photos to Booking.com whom have apologized for our unpleasant venture with Mountain Springs Resort, as well as to family and friends.  Stay far far away people!! By the way, those dirty nasty fingerprints that were on the glass windows? They were still there Tuesday afternoon, when I went back to grab a receipt, Amanda behind the desk, and a painter, painting... \n\nI would happily accept any reply from someone who actually gives a crap about this situation from Mountain Springs Resort as I would love to share the pictures and emails to you if this person exists.. I am also content at leaving this all behind us....",1,negative,"July 4, 2014",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

When we arrived at our room, we noticed how beautiful the gardens looked.  Very well maintained.  When we went into our room it smelled very fresh and clean.  Everything we needed was there. Our stay was absolutely wonderful! My husband did burn out a light bulb but the gentleman from maintenance came and changed it right away.  What lovely service you have there.

While appliances are on older side ( except the fridge, that was new), everything worked great, kettle boiled water in seconds ( it seems)\nWe liked that there is lots to do but at the same time it is away from crazy hustle and bustle of the village, so if you just want to relax it's great too. There is an outdoor pool that is heated and outdoor hot tub ( didn't try the hot tub, too hot). It is on shuttle bus route that goes fairly often and it's free! Wi fi also worked in our room which was great ( it was little on slow side but I have stayed in some hotels that claimed great wi fi and it took an hour to send an email, so in comparison this wi fi was great)! All the kitchen supplies are provided, someone wrote that they found cans of tuna, we didn't bring any groceries ( or not much the first night), so I wish I found some food for some late night munchies. Front desk was great, very nice and professional, front desk building is very nice too. It seems that they are doing some renovations to the outside as there is some snow related wear and tear on the steps. And finally must commend the maintenance, our outside light did not work which made it bit hard to get to our unit at night and he came promptly to fix it ( I think just the light bulb blew) and he was very pleasant.

data\ca\1022639\290493\217635613.html,Mountain Springs Resort and Conference Centre,"""DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE!!!!\n\nWe just had the worst customer service experience of our lives. We had booked through Booking.com.  When we were making the reservation there was nothing to indicate that check-in times were limited from 4-7. However that detail did emerge upon payment ($409 for 2 nights). This payment was CHARGED IN FULL to my card a full week before arrival, with no option for a refund! \n\nThus began our 2-week long attempt to call the place and try to arrange for a later check in. We both live 150 km away from blue mountain and it takes us about 40 minutes to get home from work. I work till 5:30, I knew there was no way we could leave before 7 or 7:30. We had a whale of a time trying to get through to anyone at the lodge. \n\nFinally a day before our check in, someone picked up the phone.  We explained the situation. The lady was extremely uncooperative and insisted I make it there before 7 like \""everyone else\"". Or get someone else to check in for me (like what?) When I asked for an alternate she started getting rude and insisting everything is on their website. Again I explained I had not booked on their site. She insisted I didn't pay attention to fine print. I said explained to her at what stage the fine print shows up on a booking.com transaction and she insisted I was wrong. At this point I just needed a solution. She goes well if you are coming Friday we will be here till 9 (she could have said this in the first place!)  So I said just to be on the safe side what if traffic delays us by a few minutes, what do I do. Again the lady started being rude and acting like it was such a major inconvenience to be asked to do her job! Finally after alot of pattonizing comments the lady goes we'll give you the entry code for your unit,  but you have to come the next morning to put down your $1500 damage deposit. SAY WHAT! The first month down security deposit on my prime location  downtown Toronto apartment was not that high!\n\nAt this point I asked to speak to someone else. She goes \""Fine, I don't want to argue with you!\"" and then I hear the same elevator music anf voice mail message I had been hearing for 2 weeks. I call again, now someone who speaks no English picks up the phone. So I call again. I get Sheldon who is the \""owner of the company\"". \n\nHe was a bit more cooperative and said a) on Friday their check-in is till 10 (can these guys get their story straight).  b) If I am delayed he will provide me with the security code to get into unit. So I explained how difficult my experience had been trying to get through to anyone. And would it be possible for him to provide us with the code now. And refused, saying \""I am not saying you are a crook, but if I give you the code now, what prevents you from coming now and stealing all our gear?\"" SAY WHAT! Anyway,  he finally says call us when you are en route and we will be give us the code.\n\nSo far so good. We do the last minute shopping and errands on the Thursday to ensure we are not delayed on Friday, none-the-less as I had predicted traffic coming out of downtown Toronto was horrendous. Combined with an accident on the 400 and construction on 26, GPS estimated time of arrival at 10:30. \n\nWe called at 8:30. Sheldon was not around. A lady talked to us who refused fo give us the unit code as had been agreed upon. she said it was against their policy and would call us closer to 10 which was apparently the new check in time in their ever shifting sands of check in time. I had trepidations with their ability to actually call us back, but reluctantly agreed. its not like I had any other choice.\n\nBy 9:52 with no one calling us, I was beginning to panic. what was supposed to be a nice pre-wedding weekend with my fiance, was turning into an extremely stressful exercise in futility.  I called several times to the number provided us by Booking.com for Lodges at Blue Mountain and we got the same elevator music followed by message saying no one is around and they will call us back in the morning. Calls to the emergency number had a similar message. \n\nso we emailed the address attached with a rental agreement which had miraculously appeared in my inbox the day before. A very rude individual emailed back saying we had made no effort to be there on time. SAY WHAT! several extremely rude emails later, where we were told perhaps they were not the best option for us to stay (I wholeheartedly agreed), the individual said she was already waiting for other guests, so it was ok for us to come a little later. SAY WHAT!\n\nanyway, we make to the address on the email sent to us and the area has lodges but bi check in. I call again and get the elevator music.  so I email again and lady gives us vague directions to keep driving up the road and that their sign is past the \""curve in the road\"". we see several lodges and inns, but no sign for lodges at blue mountain. on a hunch we go turn into Mountain Springs Inn and my fiance goes into check. it was indeed the correct place.\n\nNow begins the second part of this bizarre customer service from hell tale. We go in and the very belligerent Nina rudely chastizes us for being late and keeping her waiting.  we are flabergasted and again try to explain what happened and she starts showing us their website.  so I say no this is not where be booked and say please let me show you the tab where we booked. She starts screaming \""DON'T COME BEHIND THE DESK! I AM GOING TO CALL SECURITY!\"" \n\nAt this point both my fiance and I think that is a good idea and say, please do. we wait about 45 minutes for security to arrive. Through out this time,  Nina keeps screaming at us, telling us to get out and telling us she we would all DIE HERE before she let ua check in. Five seconds later she would say do you want to check in. I told her at least three times if she could remain calm for about a minute and demonstrate that our transaction would go through without drama, we would be happy to check in. she would not stay calm. And through out she kept demanding $1500 damage deposit. That amount is not on any website. And booking.com who we talked to after our ordeal confirmed that it wasn't. PLEASE NOTE, she checked in OTHER guests during this time, just refused to check us in.\n\nFinally security arrived in the form of an older gentleman Wayne and a younger girl Kim. Wayne refused to help us or to ensure that our money was returned. He kept threatening arrest if we didn't leave.\n\nYou have to understand we are both on the wrong side of 35 and professionals,  we have never been in such a situation. we thought it better to leave at that point. Nina refused to give us a reciept of our cancelation or guarantee that we wont be charged. she reiterated the only guarantee in life was death and looked at me meaningfully! \n\nI have no idea what this woman's problem was. Maybe she didn't like my foreign sounding name or brown skin. Maybe she was having a bad hair day, but this was the worst customer service experience of my life.\n\nLuckily we found rooms at the actual resort, despite it being Elvis Weekend, although we are paying alot more for a last minute booking. But after reading all the reviews,  I am thanking god. our amazing suite at Seasons is worth the price.\n\nAnd guess what the safety deposit at this 4+ star resort is? $50!",1,negative,"July 26, 2014",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

We normally stay at a condo right in the Village at Blue Mountain Resort, but because we needed to bring our dog with us this year, we instead opted for pet friendly Mountain Springs Resort.  \nThere was a long wait in order to check in, but I assume that this was because it was the start of March Break.\nThe Pros of this resort (it's a condo complex really, not a resort), are; it's pet friendly, it's inexpensive compared to the accommodations right in the Village, and, our loft bedroom + main floor bedroom\u002F2 bathroom unit was of a decent size - although it did not include a dining area.  \nThe Cons would include the fact that this really is not a ski in - ski out location, at least not in my opinion.  We were spending a week here so that we could ski, and we were disappointed at how far it was to the Village.  We ended up driving back and forth to the Village each day.  Although you can ski in to the Mountain Springs Resort area, you can only do so until 4:00 when this end of the hill closes.  As for ski out - you have to walk over past the Toronto ski club and into the Blue Mountain ski area in order to get to a lift.  If you need to get a ski pass, then you need to go to the Village for this.  \nI would suggest our accommodation was due for a 'freshening' both with some minor renos (paint over the drywall patches and fix peeling paint), and a good deep cleaning top to bottom.   I felt that the condo was not very well equipped.  We were only given one towel each for the entire week, and it would have been nice if there had been some of the more basic supplies available such as salt and pepper.\nWe also went to the front desk within a couple hours of arrival to report that we did not have a functioning tv remote, and no one ever remedied this situation.  \nIf I was traveling to Blue Mountain again with my dog, I would stay here again - as the only other pet friendly options are hotel rooms at the Inn or the Westin, but otherwise I would suggest that you pay the extra and enjoy the convenience and higher standard of being right in the Village area.",3,negative,"March 21, 2015",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

This past weekend was no different with the exception of breakfast this morning.  We have never used the main lodge restaurant in our prior stays.  After a full hour of waiting and constant checking in with the waitress, we were told that our order was lost and there was nothing that could be done (this was for eggs, bacon and toast what could be simpler).  Too bad for us, since my daughter had a soccer tournament game to get to with no breakfast!   For those interested, I included the details I sent management below, but the main point :  AVOID THE RESTAURANT.  I recommend Duncan's in Collingwood as a great breakfast with awesome service and ambiance!\n\n--------------\n\nI needed to get breakfast for my daughter who was playing in a soccer tournament.\n  I arrived in the restaurant at 8:25 there were about 10 people in the restaurant.  After waiting 5 mins, I approached a waitress and said we were in a hurry and would like to order quickly to go.  After waiting another 5 mins, I was able to place my order for 2 breakfast meals (typical eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast).  Predicting, that I may not have enough time after the breakfast, at 8:45am, I left my daughter to wait while I went back to our room pack up and check out.   I went back to the restaurant a 9am and our order still wasn\u2019t ready.  I confirmed my order and the waitress said, yes, scrambled and two sunnys it\u2019s coming.   At 9:25, I told the waitress, I had to leave in 5 mins, or risk not getting my daughter to her game (I think I must have mentioned what a rush I was in about 5 times).   I suggested we process our bill ahead of the food and handed her my coupons and she seemed to check them into the system and then go to the kitchen.  The restaurant was now much fuller and I saw several served families that came in after us who were eating.   At 9:30, the waitress told me they lost our order (lost our \u2018chit\u2019, I think was what I was told) and then she asked if there was anything she could do?   I said, can we have food and she look perplexed.   After being in the restaurant for 1 hour, my daughter had no food and now we had to rush to the game without options, as even Tim\u2019s was going to take time we didn\u2019t have.   I almost lost my \u2018chit\u2019 so to speak.  We were screwed, so we left and ate after the game at another restaurant which served us within 5 mins of ordering (Duncan\u2019s on the main street in Collingwood).  This is breakfast, it\u2019s not usually rocket science.     \n\nSo, the room was great, the pool and hot-tub great, the staff were polite, but our experience at the restaurant was unacceptable.  I checked in with the waitress 5 or 6 times and only when I said, I have 5 mins, please get our order, did I learn, the I wasn\u2019t getting my order with not suggestion as to how this could be corrected.

First of all, be aware that this is NOT a hotel - it's a big condo complex that seems popular with larger groups. Each condo has a small kitchen. I believe the units are individually owned and managed by the onsite management company. You can only check in between 4pm - 8pm. As advertised on our booking site, the place has no housekeeping and no baby beds. It is a bit unclear to me why it calls itself a \""resort\"" since beside the pool, hottub, and a few bbq spots outside there didn't seem to be much special about this place. I guess one nice thing in comparison to an apartment rental was that toilet paper, kitchen towels, kleenex, some dishwasher detergent, and two garbage bags were provided.\n\nOur unit was unfortunately extremely dirty - in particular the bathroom. The tub was dirty enough that I didn't want to put my 6 month old in it  since it featured lots of mold (the black kind) and bacteria buildup (the red kind).

We've done A LOT of ski-in-ski-out places now and have a lot to compare this place to. That being said, this place was very out dated and very over priced for what we found in the room.\n\nPros (kind of):\n- Location was okay but I wouldn't say it was entirely ski-in-ski-out. It's still a good 5-7 min walk to the lift.\n- 24\u002F7 shuttle BUT because we went during a busy weekend, it was very hard to catch it during the day. One day the wait was so long we ended up walking the 30 minutes from the village back to the unit.\n\nCons:\n- The first thing we found when we got there, was a broken\u002Fclogged dishwasher. There was a good layer of gross milky water covering the top (probably about 15 cm). In all fairness, we called the front desk and someone came to fix it\n- We were only given enough dishwasher soap for 1 use and we were there 4 days. We ended up just buying plastic plates\u002Fcups\u002Fcutlery because we were getting sick of calling the front desk to fix these issues.\n- We were told there would be hair dryers in both bathrooms. There wasn't. We had to call (yet again)\n- The 2nd couple had the pull out couch and we had to call (again) for bedding\u002Fsheets that should have already been stocked.\n- There were cigarette butts all over the balcony when we got there.\n- A dirty espresso pot was left by previous guests,\n- There was little to no lighting and a lot of the lights would not turn on.\n- When we booked, we were told this was a 1 bedroom with a pull out couch. We actually were put in a loft studio. Each couple had no privacy as a result because the entire unit was open concept.\n- Appliances were outdated and hard to work.\n- Hard to keep a parking spot right by your unit. Seems like people were just parking all over the place.\n\nLuckily, we had a great group and we made the most out of our stay regardless. That being said, we would not book this resort again. You're in for a penny, you're in for a pound (as my boyfriend always says). I think adding the few extra bucks is worth it to get a better place closer to (or in) the village that's actually ski-in-ski-out and closer to the fun night life.",2,negative,"February 20, 2018",796468 Grey Road 19,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

We were told that we would receive an email when the room was ready. No problems, we went to the village and enjoyed ourselves, returning to Mountain springs at 4pm. Still no email, so at 4.05pm we went back to the front desk and were advised the room was still not ready. Upon our request the receptionist called the cleaners who advised us that the room had not even been started. We were told to come back in an hour. We discovered a lounge area under the reception, while waiting here we heard more than one person getting upset\u002Fangry about the late check in situation. About an hour later we received the email stating the room was ready. Better late than never, but still one hour and 15mins later than we expected. \nUpon entering the room our 10yr old son summed it up by describing the room as \""shady\"".

This and the bed situation kept us up most of the night. \nThere was a coffee machine with filters in the kitchen, but no coffee. Would have been nice to know before. \nAfter fetching coffee from the village we were relaxing before check out. At 9.40am there was a knock at the door, the cleaners had arrived. Honestly have never been to a place where the cleaners come before check out time.

There were six of us staying in room 816 and five of us in room 911.  Before booking online, we had spoken to a representative with the Lodges at Blue Mountain, the prices she quoted were much higher than what I found online.  While speaking to the rep she did assure us that the rooms will hold up to 6 people comfortably.  The website pictures are misleading as they make it look like each lodge has two bedrooms and a pull-out sofa  This was not the case.  To have a queen size bed as part of the living room and kitchen was very tight for us as we were all adults staying in the lodge together.\n\nOn our first night, when my friends pulled out the sofa bed in room 816, it was in disgusting condition as you can see by the pictures attached. There was a lighter in the bed and appalling stains all over the sheets, which had clearly not been changed before our arrival.  We only pulled out the couch at around 12:00 a.m. and were not able to contact anyone as no one was available at reception after 9:00 p.m.  We were not given the number to contact in case of emergency when we checked in with Jenny.\n\nBoth sofa beds were horrible to sleep in, the wires (the metal) around the bed is old and dangerous.  \n\nTo add to the discomfort, there was no hot water for all of us to take a shower the following day.  Only one person was able to have a hot shower in room 911. My sister took a cold shower and my dad had to heat water on the stove and bring it up to my mom for her to shower.  In room 816, after a few people took a shower, again one of friends had to heat up water from the kettle to shower. This is ridiculous!!!  What age are we living in?  To not have enough hot water for a shower is a bit much. When I went to the front desk to complain, they apologized and admitted that the water tanks are very small.

The nearest town is Collingwood - just 10 minutes, where you will find traditional stores like walmart, dollarama, metro, tim horton's, shops and restaurants. Short drive to Wasaga Beach.\nAs a member since 1996 we have access to their other destinations\u002Fhome locations.\nAlso as a member you are sharing ownership with other members, so therefore you are required to pay yearly dues. My miff is since becoming a member in 1996 the dues have increased more than doubled and keeps going up. So the math does not add up anymore, like it did back in 1996.\nMy other miff is as part of the club's revenue generating measures, the club reserves some of the member's inventory of accommodations and releases it to the public at a price. So that leaves members with less inventory, therefore reducing availabilities. Again, the math does not add up, when dues keeps going up and availabilities are less for the members.\nAnother miff of mine is outside of Blue Mountain and its other home locations, members have access to other vacation clubs, resorts, hotels from around the globe. It sounds all good to have all these options, BUT it comes at a price. These options require additional membership fee, plus trading your points, plus additional fee per night on top of trading your points. We've had Interval International and ExtraOrdinatry Escape memberships in the past but have not renewed and will never renew. So we just travel within the Club's home locations. As a member since 1996, our current points is only beneficial during non-peak times. Who wants to travel in November. Forget about trying to book during peak, activity, holiday, ski seasons - our current points has very little value and does not give us much of a stay. The popular club's ski locations ask for a lot of points per night during ski season, holidays, peak times. All in all, we have no intentions of buying more points. You can't even get a decent vacation for one or two consecutive weeks a year, unless you don't use your points for one year and bank it for the next year. Back in 1996 it made sense, today the math does not add up when the resort dues keeps increasing and less inventory for members. Furthermore we enquired about selling the membership. The membership depreciates in value if you want to re-sell it back to the club. It's a nice resort, however I would not recommend buying a membership.",4,positive,"June 1, 2015",277 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 0V2
data\ca\1022639\472114\29523392.html,Embarc Blue Mountain,"""My wife and I were married in August of 2008 and after catering our own wedding we needed a honeymoon with downtime. Much of the Caribbean was out of the question due to hurricanes, so we looked north to Collingwood and selected Club Intrawest for the last full week in August.\n\nLOCATION\nIntrawest is at the base of blue, but closer to the main highway. There are closer facilities to the village at blue, but to be honest we appreciated the quietness we found at Intrawest. The larger facilities closer to the village just didn\u2019t seem very relaxing; lots of kids running around screaming and carrying on. You can walk from Intrawest to the village at blue, but it will take you about 10min. There\u2019s plenty of parking for you outside your door and we really didn\u2019t find any mosquitoes at this time of year (only when hiking the mountain). \n\nROOMS\n~Pros: Very clean and new. The bed was a king size and the bedding was very comfortable. A mini kitchen was very helpful if you wanted to cook dinner using the shared BBQ\u2019s and the mini fridge was essential without on-site eating facilities. The bathrooms had fantastic colours and the tub and shower was very large. Overall we were very impressed with the rooms. A good size TV and dvd player was in the room and movies could be borrowed at the front desk at no charge (along with board games). Each room comes with a balcony including two Muskoka chairs and a detachable hammock. We really enjoyed these by having our morning coffee in them.\n~Cons: The ceiling & floor walls are thin. We never heard anything from the room next to us, but could always tell when someone was above us. A couple of times we almost went upstairs to speak to the people. Below us was the laundry room. It wasn\u2019t overly loud, but at times you could hear the machines. On an adjacent wall we had the staircase up to the 2nd level (no elevators). It was very easy to hear people trotting up the stairs or struggling with their luggage. The room also had a gas fireplace that was shut down. I recognize it was August, but there were a few cool nights and the fireplace would have been nice for ambiance.  \n\nFOOD\n~Pros: Although Intrawest doesn\u2019t have on-site restaurants they do have on-site BBQs. We ended up using these almost daily. The boathouse also has a large 2nd level porch overlooking the pond with patio furniture that makes for a great location to eat your dinner. On one evening Intrawest had a free BBQ that they were hosting. A lot of people turned out and the food was rather good. They do this about once a week in the summer. \n~Cons: At the base of blue we had dinner one evening at the Firehouse restaurant where they specialize in Pizza. To be honest it was the worst pizza either of us had ever eaten. I\u2019ve had pizza out of a box that\u2019s better. The pricing for the restaurants at the base of blue aren\u2019t cheap. They recognize people are on vacation and I was highly disappointed dropping $50+ for a pizza dinner that tasted horrible. We also wanted to venture out for a fancy dinner and made reservations at a place called The Falls Inn at Walters\u2019s Falls. The food was ok, but for a bill of $120 for the two of us the food should have been much better than ok. After these two dinner situations we decided to make our own meals using the Intrawest facilities such as their BBQs. My wife and I worked in the food industry, so I wouldn\u2019t say we are picky eaters, but we do have a high respect for food and a legitimate expectation on the quality of food for the value of your money.\n\nPOOL & ACTIVITES\n~Pros: The facilities have two pools and two hot tubs; one of each for adults and one of each for kids. I think this is an excellent idea. All of which are not huge, but proportionate to the facilities. We stuck to the adult pool and hot tub, but found the pool was a little too cool on some days as some days the weather wasn\u2019t hot enough. We frequented the hot tub daily. You often had either of these facilities to yourself. The adult pool at it\u2019s busiest points had 3 or 4 people inside the fence, but often most of those people were just sun bathing. Throughout the week Intrawest does post some activities if you wish to participate. The BBQ I listed above was one of them. There\u2019s also lots to do around blue mountain as well (hiking trails, gondola ride, mountain biking, movie night, village shopping (although the village is much smaller than you\u2019d expect)\n~Cons: Occasionally you found parents+kids in the adult hot tub which became a little annoying. \n\nSCANDINAVIAN SPA\n  We decided to spend a day at the Scandinavian spa which is about a 5 min drive away. To be honest I\u2019ve never been to a spa and had little interest in going, but my wife wanted to give it a try. This place blew me away. For just under $40 each we had the use of their facilities for the entire day. The hot and cold springs, quietness, relaxation rooms and sauna\u2019s were nothing like what I\u2019ve ever scene or heard of before. I\u2019ve recommended this place a number of times to my female co-workers and one of them just did a girl\u2019s weekend here. She too was blown out of the water. Massage\u2019s etc. are on the pricey side, but you don\u2019t have to book those to enjoy this facility. I highly recommend this spa to those visiting the area. \n\nIN CLOSING\n  Club Intrawest has a very clean and quite facility. It\u2019s not a huge place that\u2019s overrun with people and will help with those looking to relax. Food choices in the area are sub-par, but Intrawest\u2019s tools such as a mini-fridge, microwave, and shared bbq\u2019s allow you to cook some great meals for yourself. The boathouse also has a public access computer for you to use the internet. We enjoyed this perk and most of the time no one was using it. If I were to re-book a place in this area Club Intrawest would be high on my list. I took note of other facilities in the area while there and I didn\u2019t see anything I\u2019d consider over the Intrawest with my next visit.",4,positive,"May 7, 2009",277 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 0V2

We stayed for an extended weekend and the studio was more than large enough for me and my wife. We had a second floor unit overlooking the pool and club house area. Although the pools were closed for the season, the view was very nice. I could only imagine how nice it is with the pools open. This resort is located just steps from what is called \""The Village\"". A shopping and dining area within walking distance. You feel like your in a mountain ski resort town, but on a smaller scale. The shops and restaurants were a bit pricey, but convenient. If you have a car, the town of Collingwood is less than a 10 minute drive and has more choices at a lower cost for food. \n\nBut most importantly, I can't say enough about the staff.  Very friendly and accommodating. I've stayed at a few affiliate resorts, HGVC resorts and RCI resorts and this is the first time EVER that we weren't asked to partake in a sales presentation that promises gifts and or discounts.

We got some color, but not as much as we expected. However, this property has an advantage over other HGVC\u002FClub Intrawest Ski Properties - it's proximity to Georgian Bay allows for a beach vacation during the summer time. Park City and Whistler can't say that. But the nearby towns are adorable and you can get a lot of fresh produce (and AMAZING apple pie) for your visit.\n\nThe Front Desk staff was all amazing. We needed directions to a nearby town for their local Shakespeare Festival and our phone GPS units would have been expensive.

The size of the one bedroom was huge! Huge kitchen! Fully functional with a real oven and stove top. In unit laundry. The room I was in had two full bathrooms. Both standing showers and then there was a tub in the bedroom. No jets which I thought was odd. Everything in the room is great. Electric fireplace to give off heat and the cozy lodge feel. Back windows looked out onto the pond. It is March so it's completely frozen over now but still a beautiful view. The pool and hot tub look very inviting. Pitfall is that you have to walk to those in the freezing cold and walk back soaking wet. But not really a big deal if you know ahead of time. Only negative comment I have as far as the room goes is that it seems that each room has its own 40-50 gallon hot water tank. So the hot water runs out very quick when you're attempting to fill the 70+ gallon tub. I'm raving about this place and I've only spent 1 night here.

Well worth the money if it suits your lifestyle.  My boyfriend and I are self-employed and we are looking forward to our future travels to their Top Rated \""Vacation Homes\"" after having purchased a 1 year membership (which, for whatever reason, they were reluctant to offer over the $20,000 package.  Go fig. )\n\nAnyways, a GREAT and almost secret way to get in there for cheaper than the @250\u002Fnight they charge, go to Shoppers Drug Mart and search their Life Experiences section.  They have pre-paid packages for GREAT deals.  Our 2 night stay package included 2 day passes to the spa as well, and our massages were discounted almost $50!  The whole pre-paid Life Experiences gift card was $299 +tax.  Look online- you won't find any cheaper.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews on all the Club Intrawest resorts and, like me,  a lot of ppl get confused when they arrive.  It looks like a hotel, but isn't.  There's not usually room service, no daily changing of the linens, no 'leave your towels in the tub if you want them replaced'.  On the other hand, there ARE free laundry facilities.  Soap provided too! I was delighted! :P  \n\nWe stayed for 3 nights in a breath-taking studio suite.  Our jaws struck the floor upon opening the door and feasting our eyes on the enchanting suite that was to be our home for the next few days.  The room smelled strangely of curry -(this was noted by front desk reception but not acted upon-) but was otherwise a sophisticated yet comfy-cozy love den.  \n\nWe spent the following afternoon at the Presentation centre where we were happily entertained and educated by Wayne Larkin.  He was very personable, friendly and courteous for the duration of our tour.  Upon completion of the presentation, my partner and I purchased our 1-year Membership with little prompting.\n\nIn the mood to celebrate, we enjoyed dish after dish of culinary splendor from the chef(s) at The Huron House not far down the road in downtown Collingwood.  We rented a movie and spent quality time together in the soothing 2 person tub in our generous sized bathroom.\n\nThe next day we were to succumb to the pleasures of the re-known outdoor Spa, Le Scandinave.  OIt was only a few blocks away.  Our visit started with an hour-long full body massage by the very professional RMTs on staff.  Heavenly.  We lingered for hours while all stresses melted away in the various hot baths, cool dip ponds, eucalyptus steam room, wooden-stove sauna and pine-lined Relax rooms where a soft nature's song was the background as we gazed out floor-to-ceiling windows at the scenery of the serene outdoors.\n\nWe enjoyed a cat-nap in our oversized King sized bed (we were reluctant to go back home to our Queen :P ) often, and found it hard to get out of bed most.. okay ALL mornings.\n\nThat night, almost 12am we were confused hearing the fire alarm go off.  We were to be transferred out of our beautiful studio into another building due to severe water damage from a burst pipe in the emergency sprinkler system.  So reluctant to go, on top of dreading packing up our cozy room at 1am, we found ourselves readily assisted by the security and maintenence crew in the transfer of our belongings.  Of course I never felt so guilty for overpacking as I did watching them haul my stuff downstairs, into our vehicle and then unload it and carry it up 2 flights of icy, outdoor steps to our new room.  \n\nOur new room was a 2 bedroom 'frat house', as we called it.  It had a cozy feeling with gas fireplace in the living area opposite the large, well-equipped kitchen complete with gas stove and huge fridge.\n\nThe master bedroom had only a half-wall seperating the batub and sink, while the shower and toilet were hidden behind a pocket door to the side.  The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds end to end, and a nice entertainment unit with a tv- same as the master.  The balcony was long and overlooked the pool- or so we were told.  At that time it was covered by 3 feet of snow.  \n\nWe were sad to leave the next day, but when we awoke, we had a message waiting from the Club Manager, Melissa Quinn with apologies for the unanticipated alarm and necessity to move us to another room.  We were to call down to have a complimentary breakfast backet delivered to our room.  \n\nWe opted for a buffet breakfast down the road at The Pottery, Blue Mountain's oldest restaurant at the Blue Mountain Inn.  It was  nice to have bacon and eggs as opposed to the other mornings we enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the great room on the main floor of the Lodge at the resort.  It usually consisted of juices, assortment of muffins, tea biscuits, raisin bread, yogurts, fruits, hot oatmeal, cereals, coffee & tea.  A bit overpriced at $12.95\u002Fpp but very convenient when your room is just up a few stairs.\n\nAll in all, this place exceeded even my high expectations overall.  Service was excellent, even in emergency situations they were very professional and accomodating.  We will be going back later this month for a night to enjoy some skiing before all the snow goes away.  \n**All Day\u002FNight tickets are only $55 when you purchase them from the resort- a $55 ticket only allows you to ski until 4pm if you buy it at the slopes. **\n\nRestaurants in the area worth checking out:  Azura's, Huron House, The Pottery, Copper Blues in the village & Beavertails!\n",5,positive,"March 15, 2007",277 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 0V2

There weren't many reviews to read, so I really went by what I saw looking at the website and the fact that they are \""gold crown\"" (the highest distinction for a resort in the RCI system).  It took us ten hours to drive up to Collingwood, so we were exhausted when we got there (driving that far with two young, energetic boys - whew!).  Things didn't start out well when I was told that we did not get the top floor as I had requested THREE times when I called before we arrived.  Unfortunately, this place currently only has eight two-bedroom units, and as we checked in later (7:00 p.m.), I guess there were none available.  Well, we had had a terrible experience at Orange Lakes in FL with people above us, and I'd sworn we'd never under anyone again if we could help it.  Well, my worst fears were realized.  Unfortunately, most of these timeshare resorts are very poorly constructed.  I do know this for fact, as my husband is a contractor, and he's always pointing this out to me.  But when you can fairly clearly hear the voices above you and hear every little bang and step...it's no fun.  Well, the worst part is between midnight and 2:00 a.m., our neighbors above us sounded like they were moving furniture.  Literally.  It astounds me  how inconsiderate and ignorant some people are.  I'm always admonishing my children to keep their voices down and not run or jump to be considerate of our neighbors.  Finally, I complained when it occured for the third night in a row, and I heard the security people go up and speak to them.  About a half hour after that (probably they'd given us enough time to fall back asleep), the people came over directly above us and pounded on the floor four or five times.  The petty vindictiveness of this absolutely shocked me.  While this resort is aesthetically beautiful, this really ruined our trip.  The nice thing about being on the bottom floor, especially in this resort, is that you have this lovely front porch to sit on, and you can walk right out to the pool.  Believe it or not, after these people above us checked out, the people that came in for the last two nights of our stay were even worse, if that's possible.  They had three little boys, who at 1:30 a.m. were running around like maniacs.  Again, is there no more common consideration anymore at all???  The only other thing I can say is that the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.  They were sympathetic to our problem and seemed just as shocked as we were at these people's behaviour.  The family pool is smaller than the adult pool (which doesn't make much sense to me), and even with only a few people in it, there wasn't much room for the boys to play in it. \n\nThe Blue Mountain Village (a ten minute walk away from the condos) is lovely, but VERY overpriced.  Also, there are a few discounts available at a few of the stores and restaurants up there, that can help if you DO venture up there to shop or eat, but be sure to check your handbook in your room before you go, because they don't ask you at the restaurant or shop if you are staying at the resort - probably because they'd rather not give you the discount.  Hate to sound cynical, but...\n\nWe loved the Scottish Piper restaurant for breakfast in Thornbury (only about ten minutes away).  Nice service, reasonable prices and good breakfast items.  Our favorite place, though, was Catch 22.  FABULOUS seafood, GREAT service.\n\nMy boys did go on a mountain biking tour up in the Village.  My boys are nearly 10 and nearly 12 and went with my husband.  While they are used to biking all around our house, none of them do actual mountain biking, so while it took some cajoling, they were SO much better off doing it with a guide.  It was just they three and the guide, and they LOVED it.\n\nIf you want any further information about this area, please don't hesitate to contact me!  I'd love to be of help to someone else.

For a short visit you cannot beat the location if you are here to ski and use the base of mountain restaurants, which are plentiful and very good.\n\nAs a result of the location, I would guess that the hotel really doesn't work very hard to keep people happy. That's probably why they don't include internet in the room price, like every other hotel in this price category seems to do.\n\nThe room is ho-hum but very clean. I believe that this is the most recently renovated of their base of the hill accommodations, but their renovation stopped short of excellent.\n\nThe first thing that I did when I moved into my current house five years ago was replace all of the toilets. The reason was two-fold. First, I bought best in class (flush-wise) toilets. Second, they were low flow. Season's at Blue seems to have a different approach.\n\nThe sign next to the toilet advertising the facility as \""Eco-conscious\"" must be alluding to the fact that they didn't add to the waste stream by throwing away these perfectly good water-hog toilets. Well, I mean, at least they sort of work, or at least as well as they ever did, I think? But have no fear, they also held the plunger back from the landfill and have conveniently eliminated the need to call housekeeping. My 9-year-old, who had caused the problem, had never even seen a plunger before.\n\nI'm not sure who makes these decisions at Intrawest, but I think they should either take down the \""eco\"" sign, or replace these terrible toilets. (And if you do, splurge and go for the elongated bowl - that short one you have is not popular with us tall people.)\n\nWhile they're at it, they should recycle the coffee makers, the stoves and the refrigerators, all of which make the joint look like a cheap motel. (The countertops look cheap too, but maybe that's just my taste.)\n\nDespite my little beef with the toilet, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would probably stay here again, although my wife wants to go \""South\"" to the Westin next time we visit Blue Mountain.

The note above the thermostat on the wall says to turn on the AC to cool it down?  That didn't work, repair guy came out and got it to work for about an hour.  Then went back to plan B- open up the windows - probably wasted more than the $9.95\u002Fday internet cost on that.\n(3) we had a unit with balcony overlooking parking lot which is not a good idea on a Friday night during spring break:  1am-2am was non-stop howling and swearing which couldn't be blocked out even after closing the windows.\n(4) had made reservation based on the sofabed being used for our kids.  Although there were sheets on the bed, there were no extra pillows or blankets in the unit to use for this.and we also only had 2 hand towels and 2 washcloths provided.

When there is such a large amount of repeat business to Blue Mountain, it frankly doesn't make sense to nickel & dime your guests like this.

We book months in advance and although the room can't be guaranteed, unless the owner stays there during our dates, we have always been accommodated. Except for this year. We arrived to find that someone had given our room away the night before we arrived. The room we were given as a substation was not acceptable and we chose to live out of our suitcases for 2 days before we could move back into that room.\n\nThe front desk supervisor Kevin, was very helpful, although there was not much he could do about giving us the room we reserved, he did give us a discount to compensate of our inconvenience.\n\nThere was a bottle of wine and some chocolate along with a note welcoming us back and wishing us both happy birthdays. \n\nThe village is the same, the restaurants all have good dishes and some duds as well as great servers and also some duds. The best restaurant year after year continues to be Tholos, the Greek restaurant. Food is always fresh, tasty and the servers are excellent as well.

Everyone was quite upset and felt this was a really tacky cash grab. Fortunately I did overhear that family's conversation and I did have my room key in my pocket. I was ready to pay and she was not asking if we were staying in the village.\n\nBlue Mountain Beach is a spot where we do enjoy spending many of the nicer days. You have to drive to it or they do offer a shuttle. We arrived and I asked for 4 towels (to cover the plastic lounges) and the girl would only give me two (one per person). She said there was a towel shortage. I looked around and since it was a chilly day there were only about 20 people at the beach that probably holds comfortably 200-300 people. I looked at her and said \""really?\"" Please give me 4 towels. I was quite put off by how ridiculous this was. She did give me the 4 towels and plenty of attitude to go with it. There is a volleyball net and rentals just as kayaks and canoes available and a bar for food and drinks.\n\nIn summary, there are problems with staff and the age of the building, but because of where this resort is situated at the foot of Blue Mountain in the beautiful Georgian Bay area, we will continue to enjoy the area. I only hope things improve and not go further downhill. We do love coming back year after year and are willing to take the good and put up with the bad \u2013 at least for now.",4,positive,"July 14, 2017",156 Jozo Weider Blvd The Village at Blue Mountain,,Ontario,L9Y 0V2

The rooms are spacious, the balconies have wonderful views, the hotel allows dogs (yay!), and the pool and surrounding area are clean and well kept. I stayed for the first time last month with a friend who has stayed several times. The reservation was booked in June under her account. When we arrived, the front desk offered us a free upgrade to a one-bedroom suite. What a nice treat! However, when we checked out, we were charged for the one-bedroom suite, which is completely unacceptable since we only booked a standard room with two queen beds. The mistake was rectified a few days later, but it still left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nAlso, the upgrade really didn't help us since it was a queen bed in the suite with a pull-out couch. Neither one of us wanted to sleep in the pull-out couch so we attempted to share the queen bed. It didn't go well since both my friend and I have king beds at home and are not used to sharing a queen bed with anyone, even our husbands!\n\nOn our first night, there was a large group of rowdy adults - yes, adults in the 40s and 50s, not young kids! They kept us up until after 3am! They were partying, yelling, banging doors, playing music, and singing along to the music in their rooms AND in the hallway. They were immature and inconsiderate of others in the hotel. Of course, guests' behaviours is not the hotel's fault. However, how the hotel staff handled them was unacceptable. It took nearly 2.5 hours before someone from the front desk staff actually told them to be quiet. \n\nWhen I told the front desk staff member the next morning, she was very apologetic and assured me that it would not happen again. She called me later and explained that she had spoken to the party directly and they would not be keeping me up again that night. However, there was no actual compensation provided. I did not get to sleep until after 3:30am and was awakened by doors opening and closing at 7:30am, the normal time for people to wake up. I would not have minded being awakened at that time if I had been permitted to sleep at 11pm as planned.\n\nTo offer no compensation was unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. I am a Marriot member and noticed that this hotel is part of Marriot so the costumer service should have been much better. \n\nI don't know that I will return to this hotel given their lack of support.

It's too expensive! \n\nWhen we checked out we requested a luggage cart. We never got one. Guests should not be allowed to hoard them in their rooms, which is what we were told. We ended up carrying all of our bags down. \n\nWe went to the pool everyday at various times during the day. Each time we went the lifeguards were on their phones. Why is this allowed???? How can they save a life if they are looking down? When they were not on their phone, they were socializing with the second lifeguard that was there- which again means that they were not paying attention. What a waste of money to have two lifeguards sitting there not doing their job. More importantly, this is NOT safe for guests! Lifeguards should NOT be allowed to use their phones on duty. It defeats the purpose of their role. \n\nAnd lastly, this is a large hotel chain. We were SHOCKED that wifi was NOT free in the rooms. The fact that you would charge guests for a basic necessity is RIDICULOUS. It is 2019....get with the times! \n\nBlue Mountain itself and the village is so nice for families.

It was a deluxe guest room with one queen bed (which we believe was a double, not a queen) and one sofa bed. The room is a fine size for a couple (like us), but a tight squeeze for a family of 4 (like our friends).\n\nWe stayed for two nights and our room wasn\u2019t cleaned between the first and second nights (despite us leaving the room for 5 hours and putting the appropriate sign on the door). That was disappointing. \n\nWe spent a lot of time by the pool, which was a little on the dirty side. It should\u2019ve been skimmed multiple times a day, but I only saw it being skimmed once - at 5pm on our second day. \n\nI was unimpressed with all but one lifeguard. A little boy who was playing in the pool had some sort of neurological condition. I watched three lifeguards laugh at him, while a fourth tried to engage and play with him. \n\nThe lifeguards had an air about them, like they were too cool to be there - not something you want to see. \n\nThe pool also ran out of towels a couple of times and one of those times wasn\u2019t during a busy stretch.

We stayed for 3 nights from 22nd September, we were staying for our wedding anniversary, so it was lovely to be upgraded from a standard room to a 2 bedroom suite.  We were given room  515 on the fifth foor which had a view of the mountains, I could imagine in the snow this would look stunning.  There was also some local beer and a box of chocolates waiting for us which was a lovely touch.  There was a kitchenette with a full fridge\u002Ffreezer, microwave, dishwasher and toaster.  There is a charge of $20 per day for self-parking ($30 for Valet), the self-parking is located under the hotel.  The hotel is located in the village, you walk out the back door of the reception area and you are there!  The sofa in the living room was a sofa bed, which needs replacing as it sits on a slant, so to actually use it as a sofa is not very comfortable, we did ask maintenance to have a look, but it seemed the same, we put a blanket under the cushions to try and keep them more upright.  The issue for us was housekeeping, we couldn\u2019t understand whether this was a normal full service hotel, it definitely did not have the Westin standard.  When we checked into the room, we noticed the bed was not made perfectly (as is normal with  a Westin Bed \u2013 it\u2019s the heavenly bed you want the most!)  We didn\u2019t think too much of it until the following day when we came back and the bed was hardly made at all, basically the top had just been pulled over the bed!  We advised reception and the hotel manager came out to speak to us and was so apologetic and embarrassed by the photos we showed her. The bed was remade whilst we were out for dinner, which then looked like it should do!  However the next day, the bed still didn\u2019t look right, it wasn\u2019t as bad as the day before, but still not the Westin standard, there was also dirty wine glasses just left on the table in the living room.  We did  normally put everything in the dishwasher each day, but at no point was it turned on (not sure if this is something they should do, or if we should, but for the amount we were using, there was enough in the cupboard to keep us going).  We did receive a nice gift from the hotel manager apologising for the bed issue, but for it to re-occur the following day, there is a bigger issue here.

Because we can't really leave Canada right now, we opted for our first ever \""staycation\"" outside of Toronto.  This was also the first time we've stayed at a hotel with our small dog.  The Westin Trillium House was great. It was end of June, so just before the summer rush.  We were a bit apprehensive, given COVID-19, but the hotel did a great job of sharing detailed information on cleaning policies and hotel procedures before we arrived.  Due to the pandemic, check in was easy - there was virtually no one at the hotel - face masks in public areas, hand sanitizer everywhere.  We had a 1 bedroom suite with a king bed.   Since we were travelling with our dog, we had a pet friendly room on the first floor, with patio doors to a little seating area and a patch of grass.  The room was a great size, had a small kitchenette with all the basics (so we could order take out or delivery and comfortably eat the dining room table).  You cannot leave your pet unattended, which was fine, since we didn't want to eat out anyway.  Twice we got takeout from the onsite restaurant - which was FANTASTIC even in takeout form.  The overall experience was nice. Because of COVID they only do room cleaning upon request, which is fine - we were only there for 3 nights.  If you needed anything like towels or other amenities, they would deliver to your room in a sealed bag, all very clean and easy.

It took a lot to convince her that it was safe to visit a hotel in this time. \n\nUpon check in, we discovered a few things which really made me question if I was being told the truth about cleaning standards:\n\n1) There was a used teabag in the kettle. Therefore, the kettle was not cleaned. \n2) Dishes that were in the cupboard were not cleaned properly as there were food stains still on the dishes. \n3) There were crumbs underneath the dining room table. I thought the carpets were steamed cleaned?\n4) There were spiderwebs on the balcony furniture. Were they cleaned?\n5) There were cobwebs above the bed that looked like they were going to fall while I was sleeping. \n\nI talked to an agent via the chat about these issues and she did send someone to the room to vacuum the carpet. I then asked the agent if the carpets were steamed cleaned and she said they were \""spot steam cleaned\"". That is very different from what I was told. How could there be crumbs on the floor if the floors were steamed cleaned?\n\nThe agent then said that \""there have been many guests that have resanitized the room themselves to ensure that they are comfortable with the level of cleaning that has taken place; we completely understand that everybody has different levels of comfortableness with the risks associated with travelling right now.\""  \n\nThat is a problematic response because it communicates that the cleaning deficiencies that took place where normal and that somehow I was responsible for cleaning the room up to my standards. The standards were actually set by the Westin, on their website and via their agent. \n\nI was told that the cobwebs were taken care of, but when I got back, they were still there. \n\nMy wife was not happy.

On guest commented they were scared on arrival that it might collapse on her. She meant that it was showing its age, and it is. The outside needs paint, the furniture in the living area was torn and covered with blankets, the doorknob in the basement washroom trapped another guest for 10 minutes as it was not working. The claim is that it sleeps 20, and that is true, but there are not 10 bedrooms. Two of the rooms have double bunkbeds and another has two double beds. There is one king-size and a few more double rooms, a couple of couches and the floor, so yes, I guess it sleeps 20. And that's the thing: You are renting this for one purpose - to squeeze a lot of people into one place to have a party. And for that it is adequate. My room had no heat in it whatsoever, but the basement rooms were blazing. The beds are atrociously uncomfortable. As mentioned in other posts, the bedding rule is odd, because there are duvets and pillows provided, just no sheets. We brought sheets, pillows, blankets and towels and were glad of it. Also, they are very strict about garbage and recycling and tidying up after yourselves. We found it unfortunate that the driveway was a sheet of ice and that they asked us to salt the stairs. However, the value is there. It is very reasonable. If you get a full house, it works out to be about $70pp a night, which you can't get anywhere near Blue Hill, er, Mountain. If you are coming for quiet R&R, this is not the place. Parties up and down the street until the early morning.

So clearly these types of units can be hotspots for parties and whatnot.

Although with it all said and done the family had a great time - with me paying at the end and the lack of respect I received results in this review!\nOur hot tub was cold for the first day and a half - even tho we told the office within 2 hours of check-in!\nWe had a fire Christmas Day in the stove that was clearly a result of very poor cleaning and about 1 inch of grease build-up under the stove top!  This fire was not small - it was to the ceiling - resulting in all 14 of us - including babies being evacuated Christmas day! We put it out ourselves and thank goodness we had not left the chalet or it would have burned to the ground.  The fast work of 3 of the brothers and the supplied fire extinguishers - saved a complete disaster - with most of our dinner being lost!  The maintenance man was very quick to the scene after calling the owner and did work diligently to help us clean the completely contaminated chalet.  We lost at least 5 hours Christmas day to cleaning along with our passes we had purchased for the kids because we all had to pitch in to clean not to mention our dinner.  Upon checkout was the icing on the cake - when they were questioning if they were going to return my cash security deposit ($1500)or not due to the damage!!!!!! I did receive it back finally. However I did not receive any apology nor discount for our stay!

If I had to mention some minor cons it would be that the beds aren't exactly the most comfortable if that kind of stuff bothers you. Also, at the end of your stay you are responsible for removing your own garbage. (Dump site is a two minute drive from where we were).  All in all, my party and I had a wonderful time and we would definitely come back again. We also really appreciated the staff at the main office.

Standard hotel rooms quickly become too small when all you have is a single room with two beds in it. I chose to book at Mosaic because the suite was sized for a family. I was not disappointed. The rooms were so generous. The bedrooms were a great size, enough for people to move around in, or relax in without feeling like they were in the way of everyone else in the family. It was great to have the privacy of closing a door when you just ran out of energy after a hike. \nI appreciated the two full bathrooms; and by full I mean, like in your house space, full counters, tubs, showers (with great water pressure) and loads of towels. The provided toiletries were really nice, unlike the dish soap concoctions that some places put out (or top up in little dispensers in the shower - yuck). Extras were easy to get from housekeeping - three folks with long hair use a lot of shampoo. \nThe beds were so comfortable, and the duvets weren't hot, even in the plus 30 C weather we had I also appreciated all the extra pillows.\nThe kitchens had everything we needed to cook and eat. You don't have to bring anything with you in that regard, there was even a pair of scissors and a corkscrew. Definitely bring along your own food and drink, the fridge is full sized and makes midnight snacking so much easier.\nI loved that Mosaic was just on the out skirts of the Village; twenty steps away from the shops but far enough from the centre square that it remains quiet enough to sleep.\nThe pool and hot tub were great, well maintained, clean, and the towel art by the lifeguards\u002Fstaff is not to be missed. On that note, there were lots of towels so don't worry about bringing your own unless you are going offsite. I would recommend some flip flops or something the wear around the pool deck, as it is pebbled and a little rough on bare feet - or at least it was on mine.\nAh, can't forget to mention the big fluffy robes in the rooms. So nice to make a late night Hot Tub run or wander around without freaking out your children.\nAlso must add a shout out to the front desk staff that graciously provided a sewing kit and bandaids when I got a nasty sliver off the Mill Pond dock. \nI will be back, and I will recommend this hotel to everyone who asks.",5,positive,"August 27, 2016",108 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

I had booked this hotel based on reviews. On entering our room (210) there was a distinct odour of stale cigarette smoke despite it being a non smoking facility. These are condos and I suspect that the owners may smoke as it permeated everything in the room. When I mentioned this at the front desk the young man told me that an air purifier would be sent. It was never sent. We were not offered another room although I understand it may have been a busy time. We purchased air freshener at the market at an outrageous price but it did little to address the odour. We left the patio door open in an attempt to air it out to no avail. The screen door was very dirty and may have had smoke on it as well.  The odour was so bad that all the clothing in my suitcase adopted this smell and I find myself washing all of my contents now that I'm home to remove the smell. We can handle smoke from adjacent smokers but this odour was intense. We are extremely disappointed. At the very least the promise of the air purifier should have been addressed and may have helped. I have no idea what a hotel can do to address this when it happens. We had to leave a $50 security deposit for any damages but frankly they should be paying me for damages. . This was our first trip to the area and thought we were getting a lovely resort. The location of the property was very good, walking distance to activities and restaurants. The young lady at check in was lovely - so unfortunate that her colleagues were less helpful. I will say that the rooms without residual cigarette odour may be lovely. There are kitchenettes that are well furnished and include a dishwasher. Room 210 may be for you if you are a smoker and don't mind the residual effect. I did complete a survey and was advised on check out when I asked where to leave it that they get put somewhere. I'm not sure where somewhere is but it might be garbage. My advice is beware of condos as you just do t know what you're getting despite a hotel like facade. If an owner smokes perhaps they should reserve those rooms for other smokers.",2,negative,"August 27, 2016",108 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

We booked a ski and stay package so we picked up a lift tickets on our check-in date early in the morning, giving our room key and the resort called us to inform us that the room was ready to 2 an a half hours ahead of standard check in time of 4 PM which was great because at that point we were all tired from the day of skiing and snowboarding.  Finding the underground parking was a bit of a chore based on lack of knowledge of the area and minimal signage but once we found it it was easy  to get around. We basically relaxed for an hour or so and got settled and then returned to the slopes to further enjoy the  Beautiful blue Mountains . Upon return to the room we took advantage of the kitchenette which includes A two burner cook surface, kettle, microwave, pans, dishwasher, and enough dishes and placesettings for six people.(depending on accommodation) we went to the pool and found it was a bit on the \""chilly\"" side at which point the hot tub was full  so we ended up braving the pool for as long as we could which was still nice as the snow continued for the whole time we were there.\nThe following morning we had to take advantage of the hot tub as everyone wanted to try it out and it was awesome with the snow still falling and the brisk wind  made it even more enjoyable and allowed for our muscles to relax in preparation for another great day on the slopes.\n\nThe only recommendations or negatives I can bring up at a $270 per night suite before tax is suggesting to management is that the drawers the Cutlery is it in could be cleaned as there was crumbs from the last tenants or guests, the rooms look a bit tired but definitely not a deal breaker and the pool could be 10 degrees warmer for the little ones as that's the reason we opted the mosaic. other than that all the staff front desk there and guest services etc. seem to be very polite and well mannered we will definitely think about staying here again in the future just hoping for the warm the pool and free wifi maybe just 2 devices you know kids and their iPads LOL",4,positive,"February 13, 2017",108 Jozo Weider Blvd,,Ontario,L9Y 3Z2

Last year we couldn't as Mosaic was undergoing renos. This year when we booked we assumed that we would 'feel' the difference after last years' extensive closure.  Nope. \n\nFirst off - and understandably this happens - the pool was closed due to emergency repairs that had to be made. I totally understand this stuff happens and is most times unavoidable. However it's 'how' it was communicated (or not) that was upsetting. The groups we travelled with noticed it several weeks before our trip because it was posted online BEFORE we were told. When we were, it was about 10 days AFTER it was discovered on line and done by email. Not great. \n\nThe size and location are great so we stayed - even without a pool access. We got a measly $10 off each night for that inconvenience. Eek. \n\nWhat I am most bothered by was how dirty the unit was. Things like: pretzels, popcorn and a champagne plastic cork under coach near edge.  Finger prints on the fridge. Dirty cutlery in drawer. Broken knob on dishwasher. Dirty kitchen cabinets. Dirty grimy counters in kitchen. Dust an inch thick above fireplace (which we wouldn't normally notice but if you are in a two-floor unit it's obvious looking out balcony).

I wandered the building and found a staff member. She said the hotel was a different building, further around the golf course. Back in my car...this time I used google maps with my own address entry and it indeed resent me to a different building. Why this did not match the hotel\u2019s own map?!\n\n3. I find the hotel - difficult to read signs, red background in dark night. NO ONE AT RECEPTION DESK! A \u2018be back soon\u2019 sign says to either call an extension (how would I do that? What phone number?)... or \u201Ccontact Georgian Village\u201D. No phone number. I search it on my phone- find the phone number.. OUT OF SERVICE. So it is 11:30 pm, i am tired, mad, alone, and have no way to check in. I find a security guard who sends me to another building up the road to check in. Back in my car...\n\n4. At the other building the B team receptionist shows no empathy for my rough night. I am trying to give him my business (which pays his pay check). He explains that the reason the phone number did not work is because the phones are down. No apology. No answer when I ask why they wouldn\u2019t change the \u2018be back soon\u2019 sign at the empty reception desk if they know their phones are down. \n\n5. He checks me in and proceeds to show me 2 parking options-1. Pay $15 to park below the building; 2. Park in the dirt lot for free and walk a bit. I ask how to get help with my bags if I park in dirt lot. He says, \u201Cpull up and drop your bags\u201D... to which I say, \u201Cbut there is no staff in the building to take them to my room\u201D... to which he says, \u201Cyeah, take the bags to your room, come back down, then park your car\u201D. \n\n6. I park in the dirt lot a 100 m away. Take all my bags with me. Walk alone in the dark at midnite to check in the room. \n\nService is your only job .

Check in was fine and that was literally THE ONLY TIME a staff member of the hotel spoke to us. We stayed 2 nights and didn't receive any housekeeping service between the first and second night. Our room was clean but looking worn, as was most of the hotel. All of the dark wood trim is really looking abused, especially in the hallways. I think probably because the halls are so small - things get banged around. The pool was good but the 'lifeguard' was a joke - on his phone most of the time and not watching the multiple kids diving into the pool, despite the 'No Diving' signs. It was actually ridiculous that the hotel would pay someone to do what this kid was doing. Wish I had that job when I was 18! Our room was a 3-bedroom unit located at the end of the hall on the second floor above the spa. Again, it was worn looking with all the dark wood really banged up. The other problem was that we looked out onto the roof of the North Face store (which was a green roof - they are trying to make it look nice to look out on) and the massive AC units that ran all day (and night) long. They were noisy but not enough to ruin our night - just annoying CONSTANT background noise.

People are so sick of hearing about the time we SLEPT IN A CABOOSE that it's a wonder our friends haven't started shunning us. \n\nSeriously, though, our room (which was a TRAIN CABOOSE, by the way, if I haven't mentioned it) was clean and comfortable and just lovely, with a little fridge and a shower and a bathroom and everything you could want.

Plus, Dave makes these amazing hash browns. I won't reveal the secret, though. You'll have to try them yourself when you come up and SLEEP IN A TRAIN. \n\nThere's also a hot tub, so in case SLEEPING IN A TRAIN CABOOSE isn't cool enough for you, you can take a soak while gazing at the 100-mile view of the countryside. \n\nOkay, but real talk: you will still have a good time at Clearview Station if you do not stay in the Creemore Caboose. They have other rooms which I assume are as nice as THE TRAIN THAT WE SLEPT IN. And you'll still get the hot tub and the view and the sausages and the hash browns.

There are quite a few attractions in the immediate area so you'll have no difficulty filling your time.\n\nOur room was a fair size with a box room off it to put your cases, etc and a good sized bathroom.  Carol's breakfasts filled us up for the whole day and Harry is a consummate entertainer.  \n\nYou can walk a few steps down to the side of the lake and watch the sun set.  There's also a bottle shop in Victoria Harbour itself if you want to buy some wine although Harry is very generous with his refreshments in the evening.  \n\nBe aware that getting to and from Midland demands a 15-20 minute drive which you need to factor in when you're heading out for dinner.  When we left, Harry gave us a map to plot a scenic route to our next destination which was much more attractive than the main highway - make sure you try and fit in a trip to the Marine Railroad, a unique sight!\n\nThanks Harry and Carol for a great stay.",5,positive,"November 4, 2016",197 Robins Point Rd,Victoria Harbour,Ontario,L0K 2A0

We stayed in the Georgian Bay Room which was decorated with artwork by a local artist. The ensuite had a nice shower stall, and soap, shampoo, and body lotion were provided.

There is a fridge in the common hallway that had complimentary bottled water and pop which was a nice touch. It was really quiet during our whole stay so we had great sleeps.\n\nBreakfast was served in a really nice dining room anytime between 8:30-10am. I liked that there were separate tables for guests and that you can pick what time you eat at. Most B&Bs I\u2019ve stayed at serve breakfast at a set time and often everyone sits at a communal table. I never liked this idea as I\u2019m honestly not a morning person and to forcibly chit chat with other guests first thing just isn\u2019t enjoyable for me. The breakfasts were delicious and made with local ingredients. They will never let your coffee cup go empty.\n\nOn that note, Paul and Linda are the most hospitable and welcoming B&B hosts I\u2019ve ever encountered. They are super friendly with a great sense of humour. You can tell they really enjoy entertaining and want to make sure you have a great stay. We don\u2019t know the area and they gave us a whole itinerary that easily filled our day. They recommended great restaurants and sights to see that we would never have found on our own.\n\nThe only small negative I had was that our room did not have a key so we couldn\u2019t lock our room when we weren't there.

It retains the plaster and lath walls, wallpapered over, therefore I'm guessing no wall insulation.  Much of the detail work appears amateurish, including the plumbing I was able to see.  It was raining when we were there and I observed water gushing out of an eavestrough, cascading down the exterior.  There were no window coverings in the room, just sheers - so anyone can see in after dark (there are neighbours on both sides.)  Our room was cold - heat got turned off in the evening.  We were given a third of a firelog to burn in the fireplace, which didn't help much.  I felt that I should have come equipped with a full thermal underwear suit, with pointy cap, right out of the Ebenezer Scrooge era.  Breakfast was adequate, with our host apparently not comprehending that some people are not talkative first thing in the morning.  Outside, there were a few slabs of stone to walk on, and at the back (actually the front of the house) the yard suddenly drops off down a cliff.  There is no fence or other indication - one wrong step and you're tumbling down.  Should make for an interesting liability case if anything ever did occur.  There are a few low-hanging branches in the driveway\u002Fparking area, which is not paved nor overly well-lit at night.  It certainly is quiet,  and the experience does seem to have a time-warp element;  like it must have been in the 1930's or '40's.  However, I always felt this sense of history with century homes,  which I have worked on extensively.  I'm also not sure how the owners calculated the square footage (7,500.)   To conclude, this is a spartan, no-frills experience.  The hosts are nice enough, but I think they need to spend a little more money here and there, and they need to leave the heat on, in view of the fact that they are asking pretty much top dollar for this area.",3,negative,"October 6, 2014",867 4th Ave a W,Owen Sound,Ontario,N4K 6L5

The biggest rip off was the $113.00 fee we had to pay for \""cleaning',etc.??????  For two people in the unit we do NOT need towel change and clean every day.

We arrived on a Monday and left on a Friday, end of January so the hotel was very quiet, all though enough people around to feel a bit of a buzz.   A few more people arrived later in the week and the sound in the hall was easily heard.  We had room 108 just past  the indoor pool area on the ground floor.  Room itself and bathroom  were  typical hotel rooms with bathroom a bit on the small side but adequate.  We used the tub and shower and had tons of hot water.    Fridge, microwave and Keurig  were on one plug so had to have one unplugged at all times.  Temperature was easily controlled. The room was neat with some cleanliness issues...fan was dusty, mirror in the room was streaked, garbage was not cleared the first day or beds touched but all the rest of the time we had no problems with the cleaning service.   The room had a patio door with screen!  opening onto the outdoor  pool area which we thought would be lovely in the summer.   We used the exercise room...well equipped with cardio, weights, mats, stretch machine....nice temperature at the first of the week but hotter as the week went on.  We were told by maintenance that the spa controlled the temperature. At the spa we were told they taking over that space in the future.  The gym is being moved to a different location so hopefully the heat problem will be solved.  We went to the restaurant every evening  because it was so convenient and we really enjoyed the food.  I eat plant based and had no problem eating a variety of good tasting  food off the menu. There seemed to be animation most evenings...a trivia evening, live music...The staff was great both in the restaurant and at the front desk.  We had issues with the door key demagnetizing so saw them often.  We used the spa for their Royalty for a Day package.  A huge kudos to the maintenance staff who worked hard to get the spa heat system back up and running for our day.  We had five treatments each and were there about five hours.   We were the only ones at the spa so had very personal service.  We were happy with the service  with some things to our taste and others not.  My massage by Sarah was great and I enjoyed the body wrap and scrub immensely.   My  facial was fabulous but a bit too much powder to finish off.  The manicure and pedicure was  my first and loved it with polish still looking great 5 days later.

When it goes on you wake up. The A\u002FC unit is obviously old and in need of renovation.  2) Our room had the smallest bathroom I have ever encountered in a hotel. This is definitely a 1 person room.  3) The door to the room is not a sound proof door. At 5 a.m. or midnight when someone walks down the hall and they are talking in a normal voice you can hear every word they say.\nCompare this hotel  to a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn, where breakfast is included instead of $30 for 2 people for coffee , bacon and eggs.  The room plus breakfast incl taxes was $212.  We thought the higher price would get us an upgrade from a Holiday Inn but instead we got the reverse.   I would not stay here again.\nOh and the restaurant includes an 18% gratuity on the bill without asking, which you may not catch unless  you check  your bill carefully.",3,negative,"August 6, 2019",10 Vacation Inn Dr,Collingwood,Ontario,L9Y 5G4

Flooring non slip I believe and looks amazing. Very impressive.  The outdoor pool and surrounding area as always is very clean and well maintained but could use more lounges.

Nice clean white towels. Fairly well appointed. Lots of storage space for your clothing, luggage, cooler, and personal items as well as cupboard space in the kitchen for your own items.  Lovely balcony and view.  Balcony has some cracked floor boards that give somewhat so require maintenance. Housekeeping staff and maintenance staff are friendly, attentive and helpful. \n\nI hope the hallways are also renovated soon, chandeliers look grubby and have been missing crystals for several years and the carpet which doesn\u2019t look that old is all water stained for some reason.\n\nAlways nice amenities at Georgian Bay Resort Hotel; limited supply of keurig coffees, sugar, cream are provided. Probably can get more if requested. Trial size bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, are provided as well which also can be replenished up if needed and dish detergent, paper towels and toilet paper are provided.  Bath towels replaced daily if you wish as well.  Laundry detergent would be a nice addition but no problem, brought my own.

A couple of minor things; the phone in the room had no instructions on how to use it so we could not easily call the front desk when we needed to, and our outlet in the bathroom was not working.\n\nA couple of bigger issues we experienced were that the TV was not working and we were unable to sleep through the night because of noise. We had maintenance go in and fix the TV and when we returned, we thought they were still in our room because it appeared our door was slightly cracked open. Turns out, it was not sealed properly. After turning the TV off and back on, it wasn't working again. \n\nDuring the night, there was a couple of extremely rude guests 2 rooms over and we did not sleep at all. We were up every hour from their noise. We could hear everything through the door. We called the front desk from google since we did not know how to operate the phone in the room, and ended up on the phone with someone from Mexico. That representative reported the issue to the front desk and they came and asked the guests to be quiet. The guest retaliated and there was a tiff, and after that, we continued to hear them all night and nothing was done about it. When we complained about it in the morning - visually exhausted - the front desk representative was apologetic and offered 15% off our next stay, and told us that they are not getting their usual clientele right now.\n\nI left under the impression I was also getting a discount on that stay only to find my card was charged the full price. When I called to have it sorted out, I was told it was only going to be a discount on the next stay and that I had to fill out a form with my complaint. I still have not heard back from submitting that form.\n\nI truly do not recommend staying here. The room is decent aesthetically, but it's no good when you can hear everything through the door.

From the moment my family walked through the sliding doors, we were treated as if we were animals. Shannon, the group coordinator, who checked us in was unwelcoming, rude, inappropriate in tone and unprofessional. We booked this hotel through a group booking for a hockey tournament that our 8 year olds would be participating in. Shannon forced us to sign a rules and regulations sheet outlining what we could and could not do.  She advised us that security was hired to ensure we adhered to the rules! She also advised us that if we had any noise complaints from any other guests, we would be responsible to pay for the other guests nightly rate! Following our dinner at 8:30 pm, some parents from our group were in the foyer having a discussion while Phil from Chime Security stood with his arms crossed within close proximity.  After a few minutes, he opened his arms and motioned us to break-up the party , to disperse and that we had to make our way to our rooms!!! We did as we were told and headed up to our rooms.  The coach and trainer of the team were discussing the line-up for the next game in the hallway and Phil, the security guard, rudely interrupted them and in front of children told them to get into their rooms and stated \""we need to break this up, we don't want any sh** shows in the hallways\"". The foul language was inappropriate, especially in front of children! Needless to say, all 14 rooms were in bed with lights out by 10:00 pm.  If Wyndham have issues with teams staying at their facilities, they should have not accepted our reservation. We would have been happy to take our business elsewhere, to a different hotel who would have appreciated our business! Some other things to note is that they charge you $100 if you lock yourself out of your room - a note was posted inside our room advising us of this policy.  Guests can not sit in the lobby anytime throughout the day, we were told that it is a fire safety issue - although they set up a table in the foyer to accommodate the overflow of people at breakfast. Funny how the fire hazard standards only apply when they want them to apply! We were advised that the breakfast sitting area is not open at any time of the day other then breakfast.

The number one thing I enjoyed about this hotel was how close it was to everything. Saturday was really the only day we drove as we went to Owen Sound to check out some falls. We walked basically everywhere and enjoyed the sights and nature of Collingwood.\nBut back to the hotel. The staff were very nice and we felt very welcome from when we arrived to when we left. The hotel was very clean and spacious. The hotel was pretty well full but we did not have a problem with the noise (except for our neighbour who had an alarm vibrating at 6:30 am every morning -.-). The pool area was clean and I enjoyed my time in the pool and the hot tub. Breakfast was decent. There is something for everyone. If you are expecting a breakfast you would get from a diner, you need to revisit the meaning of continental. I also liked that there was always someone there refilling the eggs and sausages or whatever else was low. The room was great. It was clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was really nice as well. I also enjoyed the fridge and microwave in the room. It really comes in handy if you want to save a bit of money and store some food or drinks.\nThe only thing I didnt really like was the temperature of the room. This weekend was one of those weekends where you wear a sweater in the morning and shorts in the afternoon. The room was pretty warm but the air was too cold. I feel like hotels need to invest in windows that open so we can get some fresh air. This is definitely my own personal preference though and not something that would make me not return. One other thing was the room service. They always came pretty early and we were not ready for the room to be cleaned (I like when i leave and come back to a clean room with fresh towels). The one day it was fine. We  asked them to come back and went out for the day. When we arrived back the room was fresh and clean. The second day, we had just gotten up and were about to go for breakfast (probably about 9am) and they knocked on the door. We asked them to come back and ended up placing a do not disturb sign so we could get breakfast and get ready. We left the hotel at about 10:15am (we removed the sign) and came back at about 2:00pm. The room wasnt clean. We went for a swim and it still was not done. We are not complainers and just called down to ask for some towels. Its not a huge deal and certainly will not make me not return. I just wish they waited a little longer for guests who are not checking out that day before they came to clean the room. Again, its really just a preference thing.\nAll in all, we really enjoyed are time at this hotel and will consider choosing it again when we return to Collingwood.",4,positive,"September 2, 2019",15 Cambridge,Collingwood,Ontario,L9Y 0A2

I felt very dizzy, drowsy, couldn't stop sneezing and the itchiness was absolutely insane. In efforts to find some remedy, I went to Shoppers and spoke with a pharmacist, who informed me that I was bitten by BEG BITES!

That's when my nightmare began - removal of bedding, clothes, bags, shoes, jackets and towels, etc. from my house.\n\nI reached out to the hotel 2 days later and they admitted that after an inspection they were able to find bed bugs. I was compensated for the cost of the room, but the hotel refused to cover any additional expenses related to this incident.

Our room was 'The River Room' - very comfortable bed, lovely breeze at night although it did get a bit too hot and muggy for us at times. They had a ceiling fan and a regular fan if you wanted to use it - we used the ceiling fan and it helped keep the room cool. The most outstanding part of the stay was the food!! - made by Doug - a retired chef! Breakfast was to die for - blueberry cobbler, frittata, scones with mango butter and strawberry jam, peach german coffee cake, fresh fruit, watermelon kiwi passion fruit juice, fluffy pancakes, and the best part of all - homemade bacon with fresh tomato slices and basil. In fact, everything was fresh and homemade and mouthwateringly delicious! One evening, we didn't want to go back out to get dinner (mainly because my boyfriend needed to rest as he wasn't feeling his best earlier that day) so I asked if dinner would at all be possible at their B & B. Doug was kind enough to accommodate and made us a delicous meal with wine, appetizers, salad, and lamb chops with roasted potatoes and roasted vegetables. My boyfriend & I normally don't even like lamb chops but because our hosts Tracey & Doug were willing to accommodate us, we were more than willing to try it....and WOW was it delicous! I honestly can't believe I ate lamb and loved it! We had a fabulous dinner with them as well - both very interesting people (Tracey is UN Peacekeeper and had amazing life experiences to share with us)....and their love story is too cute - you must ask them when you stay at the B&B. :) Before we left, my boyfriend purchased a pound of Doug's bacon (yes, you can purchase his delicious bacon!), and I purchased Doug's Strawberry jam, Blackberry jam, and Peach jam - all super yummy.

Bathrooms were modern, great shower to end a long day or start a new one.  \nDownstairs, a relaxing living room to chill, watch some TV, or read a novel or magazine--many of which were available (novels in the rooms, too). Being a board game fanatic, I appreciated the shelf dedicated to games like Trivia Pursuit, Pit, Trouble, and Balderdash! \nOutside was spectacular: a large deck shaded by tall tress, Muskoka chairs for relaxing and feeding peanuts to the chipmunks (we had no luck with that, but blue jays aggressively swooped down in hopes to steal them...yep, we saw quite a few blue jays). \nOne of the bonuses about Sauble Falls B&B was the availability of canoeing and kayaking. The property backs into the river; beyond the deck stairs lead downward through the tress and onto a dock with paddle boards, kayaks, and canoes a plenty. You can follow the river quite a long stretch and enjoy nature before you.  \nAt night we experienced the night outdoors courtesy of the fire pit. Under the canopy of trees, we barely saw some stars, but it was a pleasant night nonetheless.

Host is a remarkable chef who can offer you--at a decent price--a truly gourmet meal (we had bison, salad, veggies with the world's best blueberry desert). Hostess is also a most remarkable person. She's travelled the world on business and, when she's available, can entertain in a most matter of fact and educational manner almost any audience with her experiences in unusual places.\nRooms are commodious. Lots of books to read. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast abundant (especially if you have a bit of bison left over). Please, avoid the toast as there are so many other much better options.\nOnly two minor concerns. One, another place that wants you to strip off your shoes. Easier for ladies than men as ladies tend to wear sandals whilst men often have sneakers or shoes.  Second concern, for older folks, rooms are up steep stairs and moving even a modicum of luggage up and down can be difficult especially if you have mobility issues or a wonky heart.

We wanted to take on a few trails in the nearby area (the Grotto and Lionhead lookout) and thought it would be a pleasent change to ditch the trendy Airbnbs and try an old school bed and breakfast. This was our first time and boy were we in for a treat!!\nFrom the moment we arrived (late thursday night) we felt at home! Doug (and Daisy, their adorable and well behaved fur baby) greeted us with the warmest welcome, gave us the rundown, and told us to just make ourselves at home and have fun! We stayed for 3 days and Doug and Tracey made them incredibly special.\nBreakfast was freaking amazing! As a huge foodie, I was delighted to see such variety and well made dishes. Doug is a professional chef and over the 3 days we were there, we had frittatas, fresh fruit, doughnuts, apple fritters, blueberry fritters, peach cobbler, strawberry cobbler (Doug especially made this for my partner when he found out how much he loved strawberries), french toast, pancakes, his infamous homemade smoked bacon, and I'm sure I've missed something but you get the point. The food was AMAZING!\nThere's also the option of adding in a 3 course dinner, for a small surcharge. This beat every single restaurant experience I've probably ever had. Doig uses fresh and local ingredients, many of which are form his personal garden. Apart from the food being absolutely outstanding, It was the thoughtfulness and care that I most appreciated. Tracey out out a birthday card with such heartfelt words and even lit a candle and sang me a happy birthday during dessert. It was incredibly thoughtful and so appreciated.\nFood aside, let's talk about the accommodations themselves. This Bed and Breakfast has literally everything you need: boardgames, a smart TV, books everywhere, a firepit, kitchenette, BBQ, a hottub (open seasonally), ensuite bathrooms. The house is split in two: the guest section and Doug and Tracey's home, separated by a door on the main floor. You totally get the cottage feel, with all the additional perks! On the guest side, there are 4 quaint bedrooms upstairs, each with its own ensuite bathroom and lock and key.\nDoug and Tracey were incredible hosts and it was an absolute pleasure spending time with them and getting to know them. They gave us some solid recommendations for dinner and encouraged us to take some of our breakfast to-go, anticipating we'd get hungry on our hikes (they weren't wrong). They are the nicest people I've met in a long time, they're welcoming, helpful and just all around wonderful humans.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the minute we walked in and were sad to leave. I don't see myself staying anywhere else when we return to the Bruce Peninsula. We have already made plans to return with friends and family, with hopes to book out the entire space. While we loved the space and the food, what made us fall in love with Sauble Falls B&B is the warmth and love Tracey and Doug put into everything they do and every interaction they have with you.

The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  I was surprised that it was a full suite, and having that extra sofa bed was a bonus (my boys aren't big fans of sharing a bed).  \nThe hotel was quite busy the night we stayed - I believe there was some sort of convention - and it did get rather loud at night with some intoxicated adults chatting outside our windows and through the halls.  It wasn't enough to warrant a call down to front desk to complain, however, and by 1am it dissipated anyway.\nThe next morning, we went down bright and early for breakfast, which was included in the price of the hotel stay.  I was expecting a very generic (and cold) continental style breakfast, but was pleasantly surprised that they had hot\u002Ffresh food offerings, including eggs made to order.\nWe went for our swim after breakfast, and the pool was deserted, so we got to swim in (relative - the pool is right at the elevator exit) privacy.  The pool is nothing to write home about - fairly small, and no hot tub.  But the pool area temperature was kept nice and warm,and the water temperature was comfortable (even for our 4 year-old).  The facilities were kept clean and tidy, and towels were well stocked.\nOverall, we had an excellent stay, and would not hesitate to come to this Best Western Plus again if we're in the area.

We were originally told we were in a blocked area for the wedding guests and party but clearly the party was meant to stay and dissipate at the wedding. I found that it was a bit of an annoyance especially when I could hear crying babies through other peoples doors throughout the night and early morning (no one in the wedding party or any guests attended the hotel with an infant) so obviously there was a bit of disorganization upon booking. We were also in a joint room but were not connected to our other booking party (one person booked two rooms) which I found a bit strange. The only other things I did not enjoy include the bizarre smell when we entered, as if the cleaning person used the washroom before leaving our room and the fact that the windows do not open at all.

Although you are quite isolated the views around are wonderful and everything is quiet, apart from there were some flies that can be a small nuisance. Small price to pay though for the location.

The blue mountain ski village was typical of what you get in a man made ski village but had plenty of choice covering shops and restaurants, we enjoyed going there. In Thornbury we had an excellent meal in the Dam Pub which rightly comes highly recommended by Jocelyn. We only stayed two nights (one full day) and didn't do any of the hiking around the area. Not sure the area warrants much longer than say two full days at best but I suppose that depends on exactly what you want to do.

We always come here for the weekend that Thornbury has their  Old Fashioned Victorian Christmas and for 8 years we have stayed at this same resort.\nThe Resort is in the perfect location.  It is approxiamtely 25 minutes from Collingwood, so you can ski or shop. 1\u002F2 an hour from Owen Sound and walking distance to the heart of Thornbury. \nThe rooms  that we stay in over looks the Georgian Bay. What better view could you ask for while sipping on a hot coffee or enjoying a nice glass of wine?   The rooms are either 2 bedroom, plus a sofa bed\u002Ffull kitchen and 2 full bathroom units or junior type rooms that house a queen bed a sofa bed and a full kitchen and 1 full bathroom.  They both over look the harbour.  We have stayed in both.\nThe rooms are very clean.  The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly.  They make you feel like you are a part of their 'family' and never grumble if you ask for anything.  \nThey have an indoor salt water pool that also over looks the Georgian Bay.  The pool is. Ery clean and well maintained.\nThe only  2 complaints that I would have to make are that their fitness room is very small and they only have one treadmill, ecliptic machine, exercise bike, a set of free weights and weight machines.  However, they offer fitness memberships to the local residents of Thornbury, which makes it difficult to get a work out in while vacationing if there are too many people trying to use the equipment at the same time.  The other complaint I would have, although minor, is that the building itself, is that there is only 1 area that has WiFi.  You have to leave your room to get internet access.\nOutside of that,  I love the Royal Harbour Rersort and hope to come here even  when my kids are much older, as this is a wonderful resort for a family to get together and just relax and enjoy each other's company.  My kids are 11, 8 and 6.  The pool is definately a high light of their trip,  but just sitting and relaxing is a big thing for them, although they always have the choice to leave the resort and go in to town.

He explained all of the TV settings and gave us a wifi password and was really very pleasant! The room was so much nicer than I was expecting! The room was nicely decorated and the bed was amazingly comfy! I definitely recommend staying here and I will definitely be staying here again for my next Blue trip!",5,positive,"February 27, 2017",126 Sykes St N,Meaford,Ontario,N4L 1P3

Just observations, not criticisms.\nYou have free parking, WI-FI, bar fridge and  pod coffee maker in room.  We had 2 pods and asked for 2 more. There were no creamers or coffee mate creamer powder for you to add to coffee. There are no glasses. Just a few paper cups. There is no ice machine on premises. There are a few hooks for clothes but no rod-type section for any hangers, though of course you have dresser space. There is no clock radio \u002F alarm, though few would need that with cell phones. Our room had little bathroom toiletries such as body lotion & shampoo, though there was no conditioner. But again, most people bring their own. Obviously no make-up mirror or hair dryer. Restaurant closed so no comments on that. \nIf you want a clean affordable room to just lie your head down at night while you're out all day then it's perfect.

We had only one roll of toilet paper so I had to call that evening for more so we didn\u2019t run out. Location was on the main strip so everything you need is within walking distance. Not sure we\u2019d stay here again as I would have liked a pool to hang in. The beach is small and always filled with kids, which was totally fine, but the breeze by the Bay made it feel too cold to want to swim so a pool option would have better suited us.
